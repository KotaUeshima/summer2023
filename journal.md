# Journal

## Things to work on

- Stuck on how the project should be
- Goal for now: Help Japan improve English
- Think of providing a service, not just a platform for users

### Friday May 5th

Accomplished:

- Created this journal documentation
- Succesfully add users into firestore with userId as documentId
- Dispatch login and signup to redux store, which eventually will be able to be accessed anywhere throughout the app

Looking forward:

- May want to see how I can implement UI testing
- Actually thinking about main part of the application, and building out UI for that
- Come up with some sort of plan of what you want to make for the platform

### Satruday May 6th

- A little bit lost on where this project should go
