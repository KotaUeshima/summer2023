# Journal

## Things to work on

- figure out where to put dispatch for google login
- UI bug for forgot password on smaller screens

### Friday May 5th

Accomplished:

- Created this journal documentation
- Succesfully add users into firestore with userId as documentId
- Dispatch login and signup to redux store, which eventually will be able to be accessed anywhere throughout the app

Looking forward:

- May want to see how I can implement UI testing
- Actually thinking about main part of the application, and building out UI for that
- Come up with some sort of plan of what you want to make for the platform
